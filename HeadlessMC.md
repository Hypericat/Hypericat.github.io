# Headless Minecraft Client

This project emulates a Minecraft client connection to a Minecraft Server. This project was made in Java using the [Netty Library](https://netty.io/). The Headless client connects to the Minecraft server over a TCP connection (usually on port 25565). The Minecraft Protocol is heavily detailed [here](https://wiki.vg/), this project could not have been without this. The Headless Client performs a secret key exchange with the server and can connect over an encrypted connection (using AES)
